## **Overview**
This project is a web-based game inspired by "Shakes & Fidget," designed to offer an engaging multiplayer experience. The application will initially launch as a web app with plans for future expansion into mobile platforms. It focuses on creating a scalable and easily maintainable architecture, leveraging modern technologies to handle player management, gameplay mechanics, and microtransactions effectively.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Tech Stack**
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Framework: **Next.js** (React-based framework).
   - Styling: **Tailwind CSS** for a scalable, utility-first approach.
   - Real-time updates: **Socket.IO** for real-time interactions like chat or PvP updates.
   - Progressive Web App (PWA): Enabled via Next.js for mobile-like functionality on web.

2. **Backend**:
   - Framework: **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + REST API + real-time features).
   - Authentication: Supabase Authentication for managing player accounts (email and third-party logins like Google).
   - Hosting: **Vercel** for frontend deployment; Supabase handles backend hosting.

3. **Database**: 
   - **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase) for relational data like player profiles, rankings, and inventory management.

4. **Payments and Microtransactions**:
   - **Stripe** for secure handling of in-game payments and subscriptions.
   - Future integration for in-app purchases on mobile platforms.

5. **Testing**:
   - **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing of gameplay and UI.
   - **Jest**: For unit testing core logic.
   - **Postman**: For testing API routes.

6. **Version Control**:
   - **Git/GitHub**: For collaborative development and version management.
